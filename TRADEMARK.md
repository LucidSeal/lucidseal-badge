# LucidSeal™ Trademark & Badge Usage Policy

_Last updated: 2025-08-29

These guidelines cover the **LucidSeal** name, the **LucidSeal trust badge**, and related logos and artwork (collectively, the “Marks”).

LucidSeal owns the Marks. Using them means you accept these terms.

---

## 1. What you may do

- **Display the badge** on your website, app, or printed materials **to indicate your organisation participates in or meets LucidSeal criteria**, subject to these rules.
- **Link the badge** to your official LucidSeal registry/profile page (recommended) or to an explanatory page about your LucidSeal standing.
- **Use only the provided artwork** from this repository or official releases.

## 2. What you may not do

- **No alterations.** Do not modify shapes, proportions, colors, spacing, or add effects. Don’t crop, rotate, or place on visually conflicting backgrounds. Use light/dark variants as provided.
- **No confusing usage.** Do not use the Marks in your company name, product name, domain, handle, or favicon unrelated to your LucidSeal status.
- **No endorsement claims.** Don’t imply partnership, certification, or sponsorship beyond your actual program status.
- **No derivatives.** Creating new logos or lockups from the Marks is prohibited.
- **No resale or licensing.** You cannot sell or license the Marks to others.

## 3. Presentation rules

- **Clear space:** keep visual padding equal to at least the height of the “L” in the badge.
- **Minimum size:** don’t display smaller than 16×16 px on web (use supplied sizes).
- **Color/background:** use the light or dark badge to maintain contrast. Monochrome use is only for the Safari pinned tab mask.

## 4. Quality & revocation

LucidSeal may review usage at any time. We may **revoke or limit permission** if usage is misleading, non-compliant, illegal, or harms trust. Upon notice, you must promptly remove or correct the usage.

## 5. Ownership & attribution

The Marks remain the exclusive property of LucidSeal.  
Recommended attribution:  
**“LucidSeal and the LucidSeal badge are trademarks of LucidSeal.”**
